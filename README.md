the background information on my task :
-------------------------------------
In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

* Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them.
* The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination .
* Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is  reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk .
* We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end.
* We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management.
